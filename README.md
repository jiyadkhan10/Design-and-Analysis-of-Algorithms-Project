# Problem Description
Provide efficient implementation of the algorithms for the problems given below. Test your algorithms on a large graph dataset containing minimum 1000 nodes. You are also required to provide a detailed analysis of your algorithms. <br />
a. Find single source shortest path using Dijkstra and Bellman Ford algorithm. <br />
b. Find minimum spanning tree using Prims and Kruskals algorithm. <br />
c. Find breadth first and depth first traversal in a graph. <br />
d. Find diameter of a graph. The diameter of a graph G = (V,E) is defined as maxu,vєV ⸹(u,v), that is, the largest of all shortest-path distances in the graph. <br />
e. Detect cycle in a graph if exists any. <br />

# Implementation
• Use any programming language to implement the algorithms <br />
• Provide complete trace of your algorithm. For example, in case of using stack/queue, write complete trace like node insertion and removal for each step in a separate file. <br />
• Make sure to use efficient implementation of the queue as discussed in the class for finding the shortest path. <br />
• Store shortest paths in a separate file along with the printing on the screen. <br />
• Store result of minimum spanning tree on a separate file. Also show MST on the screen. <br />
• Store diameter of a graph in a separate file including complete trace of the algorithm. <br />
• Store execution time of all of the implementations. <br />
• You can use any library for the visualization of your results. <br /> 

# Testing
• Test your algorithms on a graph dataset available at http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html <br />
• Your selected dataset must contain minimum 1000 nodes. For testing, you can pick different dataset for each of the above problems. <br />
• Your code can be tested for any other graph dataset available at http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html . <br />
• User can select any node as a source node for problem ‘a’ and ‘c’ during testing. <br />
